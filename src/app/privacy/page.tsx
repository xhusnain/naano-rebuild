            <h2>What is collected</h2>
            <p>An account holds an email address, a display name and a role. Campaign records hold the posts you book and the links generated for them.</p>

          <section>
            <h2>Click tracking</h2>
            <p>Tracked links record a timestamp, a coarse referrer and a one-way hash of the visitor's IP address. Raw IP addresses are never written to the database; the hash exists only to stop one visitor inflating a creator's click count.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Retention and contact</h2>
            <p>Data lives as long as the account does and is removed with it. This rebuild is a take-home exercise and is not operated by Naano.</p>
